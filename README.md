Case Study (BPIC 2015)
This small program was used to preprocess and alter the data sets provided for the case study. It was only run from an IDE for the anaylsis. adaptions have to be made in the code for the software to perform the desired tasks. The first thing to do would be to CHANGE PATHS IN MAIN CLASS.
